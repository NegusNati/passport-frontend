# Phase 1: Critical Rendering Path Optimization - Summary

**Completed:** 2025-10-29  
**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete, Awaiting Performance Validation

## Goals
Improve Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and First Contentful Paint (FCP) by optimizing the critical rendering path on the landing page.

## Baseline Metrics (Before)
- **LCP:** 17.4s
- **FCP:** 5.5s
- **TBT:** 750ms

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Lazy-Loaded GSAP & Deferred CardSwap Hydration ✅
**Impact:** High - Removes ~75KB (30KB gzipped) from initial bundle

**Files Created:**
- `src/shared/components/common/CardSwapLazy.tsx`

**What Changed:**
- Created lazy wrapper that defers GSAP library loading until after initial paint
- Uses `requestIdleCallback` (fallback: `setTimeout`) to delay animation hydration
- Shows static placeholder (first card) during loading
- CardSwap now loads as a separate chunk: `CardSwap-ST_RxS5s.js` (75.24 KB, gzip: 29.92 KB)

**Expected Benefit:** 500-800ms improvement in FCP

### 2. Reduced Motion Support ✅
**Impact:** Medium - Respects user accessibility preferences

**Files Modified:**
- `src/shared/components/common/CardSwap.tsx`

**What Changed:**
- Added `prefers-reduced-motion` media query check
- Created `StaticCardStack` component for users with motion sensitivity
- Eliminates GSAP work entirely for ~15% of users who prefer reduced motion

**Expected Benefit:** Better accessibility, eliminates unnecessary computation for motion-sensitive users

### 3. Optimized Hero Images ✅
**Impact:** High - Prevents CLS and improves LCP discovery

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/landing/components/Hero.tsx`
- `src/features/landing/components/HeroCardsMobile.tsx`

**What Changed:**
- Added explicit `width` and `height` attributes to all hero images
- First card uses `loading="eager"` and `fetchpriority="high"` (LCP candidate)
- Other cards use `loading="lazy"` to defer below-fold content
- Removed unused PNG files (1.1MB, 1.3MB, 1.7MB) keeping only WebP variants

**Expected Benefit:** 
- Prevents Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- 100-200ms faster LCP through early image discovery
- Reduced asset confusion

### 4. Critical Resource Preloading ✅
**Impact:** Very High - Parallel loading of critical resources

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html`

**What Changed:**
Added preload hints for:
- Hero image (Landing_img_1.webp)
- Primary fonts (Figtree 400 and 600 weights)

**Expected Benefit:** 800-1200ms improvement in LCP by eliminating resource discovery latency

### 5. Reduced Hero Layout Depth ✅
**Impact:** Low-Medium - Faster DOM construction

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/landing/components/LandingPage.tsx`
- `src/features/landing/components/Hero.tsx`

**What Changed:**
- Removed unnecessary wrapper div around Hero component
- Moved viewport height constraints directly into Hero section
- Changed from `h-[100svh]` fixed height to `min-h-[90svh]` allowing natural content flow

**Expected Benefit:** 100-150ms faster first paint through reduced DOM depth

## Technical Details

### Bundle Analysis
- CardSwap successfully code-split into separate chunk (75.24 KB)
- Main index bundle remains large (910.43 KB) - Phase 2 will address
- All critical path optimizations in place

### Testing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: Passed
- ✅ All tests (29 tests): Passed
- ✅ Production build: Successful

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)
1. Deploy to staging/production
2. Run PageSpeed Insights mobile test
3. Record new LCP/FCP/TBT metrics in `docs/perf/log.md`
4. Compare against baseline (17.4s LCP, 5.5s FCP)

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Run PSI mobile on `https://www.passport.et`
- [ ] Verify LCP candidate is hero image or heading text
- [ ] Check for CLS warnings (should be near 0)
- [ ] Test with DevTools "prefers-reduced-motion: reduce"
- [ ] Verify CardSwap chunk loads after initial paint
- [ ] Update `docs/perf/log.md` with results

### Expected Results (Estimates)
Based on optimizations:
- **LCP:** 17.4s → ~4-6s (65-70% improvement)
- **FCP:** 5.5s → ~2-3s (45-55% improvement)
- **TBT:** 750ms → ~500ms (30% improvement)
- **CLS:** Should drop to near 0

**Note:** These are still above targets (LCP ≤2.5s, FCP ≤1.8s) - Phases 2-4 required for full optimization.

## Deferred Items
- **Critical CSS Inlining:** Requires additional Vite plugin setup (`vite-plugin-critical`). Deferred to Phase 2 as it requires configuration changes and testing. Expected additional benefit: 400-700ms FCP improvement.

## Key Learnings
1. **GSAP is heavy** - Lazy loading animation libraries provides immediate wins
2. **Resource hints matter** - Preloading critical images/fonts is low-effort, high-impact
3. **Accessibility first** - Reduced motion support should be default, not an afterthought
4. **Explicit dimensions prevent CLS** - Always set width/height on images
5. **DOM depth matters** - Unnecessary wrappers slow down browser parsing

## Files Changed
- Created: 1
- Modified: 5
- Deleted: 3 PNG files (saved ~4MB in repo)

Total lines changed: ~150
